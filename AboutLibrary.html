        <h2 class="qq">History</h2>
        <p>The Ilocos Sur Polytechnic State College (ISPSC) was created on February 24, 1998 by virtue of R.A. 8547 authored by Congressman Eric D. Singson and signed into law by President Fidel V. Ramos. It is a comprehensive multi-campus institution of higher learning with its main campus in Sta. Maria, Ilocos Sur. Originally, it had eight (8) campuses spread in the second district of Ilocos Sur.</p> 
        <p>Only six (6) campuses have remained. Other campuses were reverted back to the Department of Education. The main campuses was former Ilocos Sur Agricultural College, which had its early beginnings as a farm school in 1913 and polytechnic college on March 29, 1995 by virtue of R.A. 7960. The other campuses merged into the polytechnic college were purely vocational-technical and general secondary education schools.</p>
        <p>The six remaining campuses of ISPSC System are divided into two clusters, the North Cluster and South Cluster. The South Cluster is comprised of the campuses of Tagudin, Cervantes and Candon. The North Cluster includes Santiago campus, the Narvacan campus considered as the Provincial Institute of Fisheries, and the Sta. Maria Campus wherein the Provincial Institute of Agriculture is also instituted.</p>
        <p>The latter serves as the main campus and the seat of the Central Administration. The series of metamorphosis which the College went through has brought impetus and challenges to continually develop and improve its programs and services. In its quest for excellence through the years, elevation of the people and the development of the service area have become the overriding concerns that served as the guiding principles in its operation.</p>
